          Iâ€™m 23 years old, Graduated as Software Engineer Degree from
          PESIT-Bangalore South Campus by VTU. Web development is my center of
          interest, i always love the idea of cross-platform development, 1-n
          one code base deploy into almost any platform, which web technology
          like Javascript enables me to do. I also like creating Interactive UI
